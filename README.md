2. **Compile Sass:** Open your .scss file in Visual Studio Code. You will see a "Watch Sass" option in the bottom toolbar. Click it, and the extension will automatically compile your Sass to CSS whenever you save the file.

**Note:** Every CSS modification should be done from the sass files. Don't touch the CSS file!!
